                            Kiteboarding is comparable to Kite surfing, but makes use of a board the rider is attached to. The shorter and more edgy design of the board gives the athlete more control and aims for tricks and spins rather than riding waves. But don’t fool yourself, the wind will make you accelerate very quickly. Lose control and it is going to drag you along the coastline.
